# Breakdance

My submission for this year's Junction. Live demo here:

https://junction-2024-breakdance.vercel.app/

## DXF processing server

This should preferably be located in a separate repo, or one folder up, but there is no time now, as the submission deadline is looming closer. ðŸ˜¬

The server can be ran if one has QCAD, and its command line utils installed.
